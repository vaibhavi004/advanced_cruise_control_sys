## üß† Abstract

Long-distance driving often results in fatigue and slower human reaction, increasing the chance of accidents. This project presents a real-time **Advanced Cruise Control (ACC)** system using a Raspberry Pi, camera module, and ultrasonic sensor. It dynamically adjusts vehicle speed based on object detection and distance sensing. A DC motor simulates vehicle motion, and MATLAB/Simulink models validate the control logic. The system demonstrates efficient integration of real-time sensing and actuation for smart, safer mobility solutions.
